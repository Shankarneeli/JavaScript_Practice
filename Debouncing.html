         /*
        Debouncing in JavaScript is a programming technique used to limit the rate at which a function 
        is executed. It is often used to improve performance and reduce unnecessary function calls.

        Imagine you're typing into a search bar and the search function triggers every time 
        you press a key. This can result in too many function calls, leading to performance issues. 
        Debouncing ensures that the function is only called after a certain amount of time has passed 
        since the last key press.
